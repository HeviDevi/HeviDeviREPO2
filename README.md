# What I've Learned So Far

## This is a structured assembly of the information given to me regarding the prework assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp. I built this project to hone the basic skills necessary to begin my education as a web developer. Including the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I intend to refer to, and expand, the information in this guide as I continue my education in the coding field. I am proud to have built a place to practice the tools of the trade and document my journey thus far. I feel that the stress of starting out in a brand new field of knowledge is alleviated now that I have a repository of information to review and develop.
