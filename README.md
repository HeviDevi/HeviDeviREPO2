# What I've Learned So Far

## This is a structured assembly of the information given to me regarding the prework assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp.I built this project to hone the basic skills necessary to begin my education as a web developer. Including the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I intend to refer to, and expand, the information in this guide as I continue my education in the coding field. And I am proud to have built, with my own 10 fingers, a place to practice the tools of the trade and document my journey thusfar. I feel that the stress of starting out in a brand new field of knowledge is, in a small way, alleviated now that I have a repository of information to review and develop.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
