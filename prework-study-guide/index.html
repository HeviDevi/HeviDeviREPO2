          <h2>HTML</h2>

          <ul>

            It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
<br>
            <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>--HTML Element Guide--</h3>

            <ul>
            <li>At the very top, we see the < !DOCTYPE html > declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
   <br>
            <li>The < head > element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the < head > are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
<br>
            <li>The < body > element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>  
<br>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
<br>
            <li>The < h1 > h2 > < h3 > < h4 > < h5 > and < h6 > elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
    <br>        
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
        <br>  
            <li>The < ul > < ol > and < li >elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <br>
            <li>The < img > element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li> 
          <br>
            <li>The < br > element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
              <br>
            <li> the < a > element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
            <br>
            <li>a < link > element creates the connection to the external file</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
      
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</p>
          <br>
          <p>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</p>
        <h3>--CSS Properties Guide--</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>  
      </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <br>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language, invented by Brendan Eich, that can add interactivity to a website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</p>
        <h3>--Java Variable Types--</h3>
       
       <p>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</p>
       <br>
        <ul>
          <li>String data is a sequence of text enclosed in single or double quotes
            <br>
            <br>
            i.e. let myVariable = 'Bob'; OR
            let myVariable = "Bob";</li>
            <br>
            <li>Number Variables do not have quotes around them
              <br>
              <br>
              i.e. let myVariable = 10;</li>
            <br>
            <li>Boolean variables are True/False value
            <br>
            <br>
            i.e. let myVariable = true;</li>
            <br>
            <li>Array variables are structures that allow you to store multiple values in a single reference
              <Br>
              <br>
            i.e. let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
           <br> Refer to each member of the array like this:
            myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Object variables can be anything. ecerything in Javascript is an object and can be stored in a variable
              <br>
              i.e. let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');</li>

      <section class="card" id="README-section">
        <h2>README</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repository—it's the first thing that a person sees when they visit a repo on GitHub. But it's also much more than that: README files contain essential information about the repo's project. Thus, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your README might also describe some of the challenges you faced, as well as the features you plan to implement in the future.</p>
        <br>
        <p> If your project is deployed, make sure to include a link to the deployed application so people can see it in action!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>--What Should A README Contain--</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>What was your motivation?</li>
          <br>
          <li>Why did you build this project? </li>
          <br>
          <li>What problem does it solve?</li>
          <br>
          <li>What did you learn?</li>
          <br>
          <li>What makes your project stand out?</li>
