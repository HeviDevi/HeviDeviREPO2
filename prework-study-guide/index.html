          <h2>HTML</h2>

          <ul>

            <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
<br>
            <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>--HTML Element Guide--</h3>

            <ul>
            <li>At the very top, we see the < !DOCTYPE html > declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
   <br>
            <li>The < head > element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the < head > are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
<br>
            <li>The < body > element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>  
<br>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
<br>
            <li>The < h1 > h2 > < h3 > < h4 > < h5 > and < h6 > elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
    <br>        
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
        <br>  
            <li>The < ul > < ol > and < li >elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <br>
            <li>The < img > element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li> 
          <br>
            <li>The < br > element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
              <br>
            <li> the < a > element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
            
          </ul>
